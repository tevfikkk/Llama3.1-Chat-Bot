## This doc sucks sorry in advanced

<ul>
  <li>Ollama is used for the model server. Look around for its documentation.</li>
  <li>The model doesn't matter. I've used <a href="https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-GGUF">this one</a></li>
  <li>.Net Core Rest API without database as I ain't needed a database.</li>
  <li>Single html file including boilerplate sh**ity javascript inside of it, hope you can do it better. I suck at frontend</li>
  <li>It is still in development</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
